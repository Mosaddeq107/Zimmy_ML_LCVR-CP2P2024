# Creating a Python Development Environment in GitHub Codespaces

For this project, the majority of the code will be written strictly in Python. Therefore, we need to setup a development environment that allows up to read and write python code easily. We will then create a development environment in GitHub codespaces for this purpose.

We will first navigate to the dropdown menu at the top-right corner of the GitHub web interface and select "New codespace"

Then we'll select the repository and branch we'd like to work on. Here, I'm working on this repository (ML_LCVR-CP2P2024) on the main branch. Then click the "Create codespace" button.

Now navigate to the search bar at the top of the screen and type in ">add dev" to find the command "Add Developer Configuration Files", then select it.

Select "Create a New Configuration"

Select "Show All Configurations", then search for the language you need a development configuration for. In our case we'll be using Python 3.

You will be prompted to select a build version and additional features that you desire. If you're not sure, just select the default with no additional features for now. Once you've selected these, your development environment is good to go. You should see the file "devcontainer.json" now in your respository.
